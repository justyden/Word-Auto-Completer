It urged that the next Legislature "provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected".
The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes.
"This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program", the jury said, but the State Welfare Department "has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County, which receives none of this money.
The jurors said they realize "a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties".
Nevertheless, "we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds", the jurors said. "Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden" on Fulton taxpayers.
The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers, guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation.
All Dallas members voted with Roberts, except Rep& Bill Jones, who was absent. _AUSTIN, TEXAS_- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas' big cities Thursday.
Rep& James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise, a Wise County hamlet of 250 people.
When the shouting ended, the bill passed, 114 to 4, sending it to the Senate, where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen& George Parkhouse of Dallas.
Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen& Parkhouse. The bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project.
Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas.
Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds, and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill, did not sway Cotten's attack.
The bill's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J& W& Buchanan of Dumas, Eligio (Kika) de la Garza of Mission, Sam F& Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of Sulphur Springs.
"This is a poor boy's bill", said Chapman. "Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds. This would help the little peanut districts".

 excellent product for the price
very pleased with this headset
dont waste your money and time
i especially love the long battery life
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out
works great
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service
ill be looking for a new earpiece
i highly recommend this device to everyone
jawbone era is awesome too
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week  but still lasts longer than thereplacement
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best
an awesome new look for fall
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip
price is good too
dont make the same mistake i did
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model
its really easy
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect
fantastic earphones
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car
low quality
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before
warning  stay away
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money
awsome device works great
i used to talk on it for     hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone
very displeased
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install
restored my phone to like new performance
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx series  which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value
does not fit
very happy with this product
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced
portable and it works
my colleague  i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had   left in the morning
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses
timely shipment and quality product
nice solid keyboard
very well made and fits my surefire gx perfectly
horrible phone
bt battery junk
we would recommend these to others
cant get the software to work with my computer
disappointed
poor voice clarity
the battery works great
no buyers remorse on this one
very disappointed in accessoryone
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers
looks great and is strong
i have had tmobile service for  or  years now and i am pretty happy with it
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear
great software for motorolas
the delivery was on time
very easy to use
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx env
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous
id like to return it
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple
after charging overnight these batteries work great
you wont regret it
i love this phone
a disappointment
its not user friendly
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute
this pda rocks
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles
i would definitely recommend the jabra btv for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price
i had verizon  years ago and really liked their service
pretty piece of junk
plug was the wrong size
works as described
save your money ive had this item for  months now
bad purchase
well im satisfied
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter
this battery is an excellent bargain
defective crap
i would have given no star if i was able
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing
i would not recommend this item to anyone
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad
greatno problems at all
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far
very good product well made
mobile phone tools are a must have
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source
the phone is sturdy and waterproof
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to of
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great
works great
really ugly
horrible had to switch  times
the noise shield is incrediable
no real improvement
razr battery  good buy
keep up the good work amazon
they refuse to refund or replace
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing
great case and price
all it took was one drop from about  inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing
bluetooth range is good  a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly
i am glad i purchased it
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this
dont buy this product
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better
i love the camera its really pretty good quality
thank you for such great service
its a total package
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again
i give wirefly  stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice
its aggravating
great product for the price
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone
none of it works just dont buy it
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off
please dont waste your money
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design
disapointing results
cumbersome design
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected
great product
its a piece of crap
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated
this fixes all the problems
worst ever
i am very happy
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what
the battery life is highly unacceptable
that company is a joke
it does everything the description said it would
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data
voice quality signal strength dropped calls
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not
better than expected
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them
battery is holding up well
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking
sprint  terrible customer service
linked to my phone without effort
they are so cool
easy to use
better than new
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea
piece of trash
a pretty good product
this is a great phone
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking
those phones are working just fine now
i am more than happy with this product
poor construction
this is infuriating
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman
sprint charges for this service
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on
it doesnt work in europe or asia
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like  cents upandcoming
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and  is pretty comfortible to wear  hours a day without pain in the ear
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e is the worst i have ever seeen
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone
poor product
however i needed some better instructions
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs
worked very well paired with a treo w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack
do not buy do not buyit sucks
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul
very dissapointing performance
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp players in the family
dont bother  go to the store
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed
you get what you pay for i guess
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it
these are fabulous
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer
performed awful  muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call
very windresistant
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are
great phone
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides
im pleased
battery is terrible
i found the product to be easy to set up and use
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear
utter crap sound quality is terrible
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high
talk about useless customer service
it felt too light and tinny
this does not fit the palm tungsten e and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones
its welldesigned and very sharp  the blue is a very nice color
does everything it should and more
i could not recommend these more
nice sound
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with
setup went very smoothly
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping
cant upload ringtones from a third party
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked
truly awful
it works fine on my motorola  cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud
and none of the tones is acceptable
camera color balance is awful
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat
chinese forgeries abound
easy to pair with my samsung cell
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well
too bad you have to pay up to  a month for the service
works well
the nokia ca usb cable did not work with my phone
clear crisp sound
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear
do not buy if you want to use the holster
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips
it doesnt make you look cool
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all
comfortable fit  you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mps preferably ripped by windows media player
you cant beat the price on these
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously
lightweight and works well
so just beware
i love this cable  it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my vi
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim
it lasts less than o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem
poor quality
jabra ear gels r the best
not worth it
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced
it quit working after id used it for about  months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc
it was a great phone
if you simply want a small flip phone  look elsewhere as the extra bells  whistles are mediocre
good value works fine  power via usb car or wall outlet
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa  is that the new phone on tv
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is  functional
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more
after receiving and using the product for just  days it broke
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold
we have tried  units and they both failed within  months pros
provides good protection and looks classy too
krussel always good
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc
the design is very good
i great reception all the time
i would highly recommend this product
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is
stay away from this store be careful
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome
does not fit
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time
disappointing
blue ant is easy to use
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use
its very convenient and simple to use  gets job done  makes the car ride so much smoother
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed
the sound quality is excellent as well
its the best headset i have used
would not reccommend
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date
just what i wanted
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone
wont work right or atleast for me
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it
i really wanted the plantronics  to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good
great product
crisp and clear
after the first charge kept going dead after  minutes
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem
the reception has been generally good
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot
great bluetooth
i highly recommend this case
worthwhile
this is a great deal
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part
i am sorry i made this purchase
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount
it was horrible
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first
they work about  weeks then break
it is simple to use and i like it
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync  for optimal data synchronization results
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting
not what i wanted
i own  of these cases and would order another
great phone
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked
perfect for the ps
five star plus plus
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me
down the drain
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great
good  works fine
for the price this was a great deal
great price too
if there is a wind it is completely useless
yes its shiny on front side  and i love it
does not work
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at  until i plugged it into my phone vc razr
the reception through this headset is excellent
thumbs up to this seller
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds  feet line of sight
improper description i had to return it
it works   it is comfortable
battery chargelife is quite long
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well
battery has no life
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing
product is exactly as described
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont
doesnt do the job
i would recommend it
plan on ordering from them again and again
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too
awkward to use and unreliable
the shipping time was also very quick
not as good as i had hoped
good case
doesnt work
really good product
unfortunately it did not work
all three broke within two months of use
dont buy it
my father has the v and the battery is dying
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently
horrible horrible protector
i dont like this nokia either
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone
terrible my car will not accept this cassette
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the  cellphones i was planning to use it with
its not what it says it is
stay away from the q
used and dirty
very unreliable service from tmobile
not good enough for the price
i bought two of them and neither will charge
it looks very nice
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet
comfortable in my hand
just does not work
poor reliability
it works
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing
terrible product and waste of money
last time buying from you
it was a waste of my money
so far it has worked like a charm
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone
would recommend this item
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation
nice case feels good in your hands
the item received was counterfeit
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had
works fine
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip
my sister has one also and she loves it
good quality
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon
excellent dualpurpose headset
excellent
does not work for listening to music with the cingular
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint
having trouble with volume
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears
warning  do not buy
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort
best headset ever
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics  maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips
excellent product for the price
bad reception
this product is very high quality chinese crap
it was quite comfortable in the ear
great phone
dont buy this product  it fails
everything about this product is wrongfirst
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts
terrible phone holder
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product
how stupid is that
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors
good show samsung
so i bought about  of these and saved alot of money
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed
couldnt figure it out
my phone sounded ok  not great  ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop
leopard print is wonderfully wild
works for me
saggy floppy piece of junk
much better than the hard plastic cases
it also had a new problem
happy so far
cool phone
works good
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two
but it is great i would really recommend it
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it
as i said abovepretty useless
never got it
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise
down the drain because of a weak snap
does not charge the cingular att  phone
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase
logitech bluetooth headset is a
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low
im returning them
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound
nice leather
i had to purchase a different case
it is a joy to use
very much disappointed with this company
very satisifed with that
it didnt charge for me
this is the phone to get for  i just bought my sa and all i can say is wow
buttons are too small
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow
love it great armband
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons
i exchanged the sony ericson za for this and im pretty happy with that decision
i was very impressed with the price of the cases
also makes it easier to hold on to
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great
its pretty easy
i cannot make calls at certain places
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does
beautiful styling though
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back
im trying to return it for a refund
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked
excellent product
earbud piece breaks easily
lousy product
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet
sweetest phone
oh the charger seems to work fine
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal
not enough volume
echo problemvery unsatisfactory
you could only take  videos at a time and the quality was very poor
dont waste your money
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product
adapter does not provide enough charging current
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered
phone falls out easily
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work
painful on the ear
lasted one day and then blew up
disappointed
kind of flops around
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone
item does not match picture
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once
 wonderful years
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there
the original body and soul  is a masterpiece
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake
this may be the only bad film he ever made
so badwellits just bad
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this
i thought it was bad
both films are terrible but to the credit of the  version it was watchable
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad
the script is a big flawed mess
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak  monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films
the movie is terribly boring in places
the lighting is awful
the film looks cheap and bland
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here
the visual effects were awful
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus
not recommended
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg rating certainly wont allow
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer
the budget was evidently very limited
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up
filmiing was less expansive
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original
generally it just lacked imagination
not recommended
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review
being a s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons
but tiny toons kept the s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense
the story line is just awful
its just painful
and the accents are absolutely abysmal
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film
i believe that pitch black was done well
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it
go watch it
omit watching this
very funny
my rating just  out of
the characters are interesting and you really care for them
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits
dont miss it
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew
regardless the film fails on most levels
avoid at all costs
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was
ill give this film  out of
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver
but it is entertaining nonetheless
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts
the cast is always entertaining as usual
overall a delight
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created
the film lacks any real scares or tension  some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least  i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself
the least said about the acting the better
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy
excellent performance
there still are good actors around
also great directing and photography
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb  complex
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design  costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar
even allowing for poor production values for the time  and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles
it is not good
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy
then the film just dropped the ball
this is a stunning movie
raw and sublimely moving
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences
all of the main players are mesmerising
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike
julian fellowes has triumphed again
hes a national treasure
go and see it
this is an excellent film
the aerial scenes were welldone
it was also the right balance of war and love
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference
a good film by a great director
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene
this is just a great movie
out of  stars
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films
i advise you to look out for it
you wont regret it
highly recommended a
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage
its a case of so bad it is laughable
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes
how awful she is
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures
the results well are a shame
delete this film from your mind
one of the worst shows of all time
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors
lame would be the best way to describe it
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong
you can find better movies at youtube
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie
its an empty hollow shell of a movie
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on
avoid avoid avoid
it will drive you barking mad
the transfers are very good
very nice and relaxing late night viewing
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title
some great music and terrific scenery
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here
a happy wonderful feel good ending
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized
nothing new there
that was done in the second movie
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted
what on earth is irons doing in this film
i just saw this film and i recommend it
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable
the football scenes at the end were perplexing
but i thought his acting was skilled
meredith m was better than all right
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early s
a standout scene
this scene is very strong and unpleasant
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son
this movie is also revealing
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue
and it was boring
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard
you wont forget this movie
why was this film made
the film has an ultracheap look to it
the result is a film that just dont look right
none of them are engaging or exciting
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time
i saw it as a child on tv back in  when it was the stranger and i loved it
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr
this movie is so awesome
i loved it it was really scary
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there
if you want a real scare rent this one

this is an extraordinary film
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole
predictable but not a bad watch
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part
she carries the movie well
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release
avoid at all costs
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards
the only place good for this film is in the garbage
the worst one of the series
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way
of course the footage from the s was grainy but that only enhanced the film
this film offers many delights and surprises
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film
the story unfolds in th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie  but you do wish for just a small sample to savor
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn
conclusion  i loved it
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead  or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with    years down the line
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in  as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south
trumbull on i love lucy
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last  years
see both films if you can
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist
its very slow
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend  years between his childhood and mature age
dont waste your time
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen
im still trying to get over how bad it was
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle
hour  minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking
lots of holes in the script
its like a bad two hour tv movie
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong
the dialogue is atrocious
the acting is beyond abysmal
everything stinks
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time
in short dont bother with this movie
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame
a film not easily forgotten
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular
great movie
also the story and acting were weak
at around  pm i bought it at around pm i started to watch at around pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt
either way it sucks
the script is horrendously stupid
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid
what the hell kind of crap is that
then theres the plot holes
you could drive a semi truck into these holes
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film
shes poised and amazing
dee snider just plain sucks
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid
avoid at any and all costs
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies
avoid this film at all costs
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict
now this is a movie i really dislike
its one of the most boring horror movies from the s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere
the puppets look really cheesy  not in a good way like in the puppet master s flicks
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next
otherwise dont even waste your time on this
this one just fails to create any real suspense
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying
hated it
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed  but not quite that bad
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash
this is not moviemaking
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes
excellent short film
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys
the story line is totally predictable
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie
bad characters bad story and bad acting
really awful
not easy to watch
funny clever hip  just like prays previous film hype
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie
i rate this movie
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful
the story is also both funny and poignant at times
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it
go rent it
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings
brilliance indeed
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you
think of the film being like a dream
simply beautiful
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess
the movie seemed a little slow at first
but it picked up speed and got right to the point
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget
i enjoyed it
i have recommended it to friends
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine
the films dialogue is natural real to life
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in  deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting
then i watched it again two sundays ago march th  and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing
it is a very well acted and done tv movie
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film
i keep watching it over and over
its a sad movie but very good
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it
she is as lovely as usual this cutie
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow
recommend with confidence
this movie is well balanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sex obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the male bonding scenes were a hoot
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch
fans of the genre will be in heaven
lange had become a great actress
it looked like a wonderful story
i never walked out of a movie faster
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script
in a word it is embarrassing
exceptionally bad
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money
